<objective>
Rapid feasibility validation through focused, throwaway experiments. Each spike answers one
specific question with observable evidence. Spikes live in `.planning/spikes/` and integrate
with GSD commit patterns, state tracking, and handoff workflows.

Does not require `/gsd-new-project` — auto-creates `.planning/spikes/` if needed.

**Available flags:**
- `--quick` — Skip decomposition/alignment, jump straight to building. Use when you already know what to spike.

<process>
Execute the spike workflow from @/home/scott/Documents/code/rest-storage-passwords-manager/.qwen/get-shit-done/workflows/spike.md end-to-end.
Preserve all workflow gates (decomposition, risk ordering, verification, MANIFEST updates, commit patterns).
