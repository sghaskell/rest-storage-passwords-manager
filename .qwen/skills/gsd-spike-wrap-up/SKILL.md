<objective>
Curate spike experiment findings and package them into a persistent project skill that Claude
auto-loads in future build conversations. Also writes a summary to `.planning/spikes/` for
project history. Output skill goes to `./.qwen/skills/spike-findings-[project]/` (project-local).

Execute the spike-wrap-up workflow from @/home/scott/Documents/code/rest-storage-passwords-manager/.qwen/get-shit-done/workflows/spike-wrap-up.md end-to-end.
Preserve all curation gates (per-spike review, grouping approval, QWEN.md routing line).
